This program is designed to input the user's assignments into their Google Calendar automatically. We thought of this idea because we did not like having to manually input our assignments into Google Calendar, which is our main calendar/planner. Since our assignments are on Avenue to Learn, we could use web scraping to extract our assignments from Avenue, and use the Google Calendar API to automatically input it onto the calendar.

In order to add your assignments to Google Calendar, you need to implement the requirements in the requirements.txt, since you need to set up the libraries and venv. Then, fill out your credentials and run eventAdder to see your assignments appear on the calendar.
